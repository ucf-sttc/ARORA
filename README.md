# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
1. Launch the project in Unity as normal. The initial load will take several hours as it is regenerating the library folder
2. In the menu bar go to Window->Package Manager and ensure that the Addressable 1.1.10 package is installed
3. In the project panel go to Assets/Scenes and make sure all the numbered scenes have been marked as addressable. There will be a checkbox in the inspector of each scene and they can be selected as a group to speed up the process of checking
3. If you intend to create an executable this step must be completed before beginning the build. It is not necessary for testing in the editor
   1.In the menu bar go to Window->Asset Management->Addressables
   2.In the Addressables window select build from the menu bar. This process takes several hours and must be repeated if the scenes have been updated
